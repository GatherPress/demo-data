### About

- **Images can only be referenced by URL**, that's why I added them to this repo and used the `raw.githubusercontent.com`-URLs [within WordPress](https://github.com/GatherPress/demo-data/issues/4#issuecomment-2083850813).
- The exported demo-data is **cleaned up ~~manually~~ automatically** from all default contents, that got added during the default WordPress installation *(inside the WordPress playground)*.
- [GitHub Proxy](https://github-proxy.com/) is a great service by @stoph.
