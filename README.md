# What

This repo provides the latest version of [GatherPress](https://github.com/GatherPress/gatherpress/releases) ~~as zip archive~~, to be used with different `blueprint.json` files to run WordPress playground instances for the following purposes:

- Install and activate GatherPress to be able [start creating demo-data](https://playground.wordpress.net/?blueprint-url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/carstingaxion/gatherpress-demo-data/main/gatherpress-blank-install-blueprint.json).
- Install and activate GatherPress and use the demo-data to *test the main branch of the plugin* during development. ([#8](https://github.com/carstingaxion/gatherpress-demo-data/issues/8))
- Install and activate GatherPress and use the demo-data to [showcase the plugin](https://playground.wordpress.net/?blueprint-url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/carstingaxion/gatherpress-demo-data/main/gatherpress-demo-blueprint.json).
- Install and activate GatherPress and use the demo-data to [showcase the plugin to editors](https://playground.wordpress.net/?blueprint-url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/carstingaxion/gatherpress-demo-data/main/gatherpress-editor-demo-blueprint.json).
- Install and activate GatherPress and use the demo-data to *see block-variation experiments* in the [GatherPress `block` Playground](https://github.com/carstingaxion/gatherpress-block-playground).
- [Create, read update and delete](https://playground.wordpress.net/?blueprint-url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/carstingaxion/gatherpress-demo-data/main/blueprints/gatherpress-save-export-to-server-blueprint.json) the demo-data using Playground and persist it with a PR onto *this repo*.
- [CRUD with prepared settings for GitHub Export][export-to-github] the demo-data using Playground and persist it with a PR onto *this repo*.

## How

- The `...-blueprint.json` files are made & validated using the playground-based [blueprint builder][builder]

   ![gatherpress-demo-data-playground-builder](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/carstingaxion/gatherpress-demo-data/main/2024/06/gatherpress-demo-data-playground-builder.png)
- **Images can only be referenced by URL**, that's why I added them to this repo and used the `raw.githubusercontent.com`-URLs [within WordPress](https://github.com/carstingaxion/gatherpress-demo-data/issues/4#issuecomment-2083850813).
- The exported demo-data is **cleaned up ~~manually~~ automatically** from all default contents, that got added during the default WordPress installation *(inside the WordPress playground)*.
- ~~The exported & cleaned up demo-data [needs to be uploaded](https://github.com/carstingaxion/gatherpress-demo-data/compare) to this repository, maybe as new one or as replacement for an existing demo-data set.~~

# Why

~~I was not able to run a WordPress playground using any of the existing URLs of zipped plugin versions.~~

~~While the playground docs suggest to use raw.githubusercontent.com for CORS reasons, I was not able to find a working, *non 404*, URL structure.~~

~~I tried and failed, with:~~

- ~~https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GatherPress/gatherpress/archive/refs/tags/0.28.0.zip~~
- ~~https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GatherPress/gatherpress/releases/download/0.28.0/gatherpress.zip~~

~~So I created [this repo](https://github.com/carstingaxion/gatherpress-demo-data), which houses the zip file of the current version of *GatherPress*, as well as the `blueprint.json` files to create demo-data and to run a demo using that data.~~
